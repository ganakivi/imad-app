        it is the best thing with a little improvement in my experience. there is nothing wrong in trying this. i normally won't get angry.
        But in fact there is no situations that i faced made me angry that is the truth. i have not faced any difficult situations.
        but if some situations lead to angry there is a feel always come that this is not the correct situation. and a lecture begins in my
